**HTML&CSS Login Project**


----------
This project involved building the basis for a Login screen using HTML5 and CSS3 with Visual Studio as the IDE.  I wanted to explore the options and make it reasonably aesthetically pleasing.

I enjoyed the look and feel of the end result and will likely go back at a later date and explore adding some additional functionality.
