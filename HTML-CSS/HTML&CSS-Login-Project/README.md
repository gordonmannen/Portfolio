**HTML&CSS Login Project**


----------
This project involved building the basis for a Login screen using HTML5 and CSS3 from within Visual Studio.  I wanted to explore some of the options and make it reasonably aesthetically pleasing.

I enjoyed the look and feel of the end result and will return at a later date and add functionality as I continue using HTML/CSS professionally.
