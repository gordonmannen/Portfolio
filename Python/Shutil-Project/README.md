### Shutil Project
***

This project began with a simple automated file transfer, and then I added additional functionality from there.

Initially it is a simple automated file transfer using the shutil module with Python 2.7 in IDLE.  The program checks a particular source folder and transfers any files, in this case limited to text files, to a destination folder.  In the process the program will list the files in the source folder and the associated file path, and a list of the files in the destination folder following the execution of the file transfer.
