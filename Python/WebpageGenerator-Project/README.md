### Webpage Generator Project
***

The starting point for this project was a simple program that could be run using Python 3.5.1 that would generate a simple webpage, this could be implemented for a more complicated site, but I wanted to keep the test case very simple.  When the program is executed it will generate a webpage that can be viewed in a browser of the user's choice.

To expand upon this base, I added a Tkinter GUI that allows the user to modify the text that will be generated with the webpage, the event to generate the content is now tied to a 'submit' button click.

Finally, to further expand the functionality, I modified the program and the Tkinter GUI to include interaction with SQLite to store what could essentially become content templates that could then be generated as webpages based on a selection chosen from a listbox.
