### Webpage Generator Project
***

The starting point for this project was a simple program that could be run using Python 3.5.1 that would generate a simple webpage, this could be implemented for a more complicated site, but I wanted to keep the test case very simple.  When the program is executed it will generate a webpage that can be viewed in a browser of the user's choice.
