**Simple Pygame Project**


----------
This project was a creative project, exploring some of the features available in the Pygame module.  I used Python 3.5.1 in Visual Studio to create this simple game for my three year old son who is a big fan of pigs.  The 'player' is represented by a flying pig image and the background is a rustic farm.  When launching the game as the mouse is moved across the screen the "TJ Pig" character moves across the screen and if the mouse is clicked it will trigger a pig sound.

My son greatly enjoyed playing around with this simple game, so my target audience was satisfied.  In time I would like to delve further into the features and capability of Pygame for developing 2D and 3D games as game development is something that I find fascinating and want to explore.
