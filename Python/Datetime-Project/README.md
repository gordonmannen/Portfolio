### Datetime Project
***

This is a simple program using the datetime module with Python 2.7 in IDLE.

When the program is executed it returns the current data regarding the day of the week, date, and time at the local office and returns similar data for an office in London and another in New York City.

The program checks the times that those offices are open and returns a message indicating whether that specific office is currently open or closed.
