### City Library Project
***

This was a project I used to expand upon my knowledge of a number of facets of SQL CRUD operations, stored procedures, etc.  I used Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 for this project.  The project involves creating a simple library management system and then testing it by creating a number of queries and stored procedures to determine if it is working properly.  To accomplish this I created the database and tables from scratch and populated the base data.  After resolving some syntax related errors and testing my queries and stored procedures, the system worked as desired.
