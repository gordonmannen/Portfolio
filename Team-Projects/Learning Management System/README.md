### Team Project - Learning Management System
***

This project was performed while participating in an internship for Prosper IT Consulting as I was attending the Tech Academy in Portland, Oregon.  The scope of this project involved modifying and adding to an existing live online learning management system.  The work was accomplished using ASP.NET MVC and Web Forms primarily within Visual Studio while adding, modifying, and analyzing code written in C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, as well as using the MVC razor syntax.

The two primary objectives for this project were adding an additional layer of security using MVC Identity to differentiate roles and user access, and creating a Web Form template that could be applied wherever an essay question was asked in the curriculum so the student's answer could be automatically emailed to the instructors upon a button click event.
