### Portfolio
***

Previously I used my problem-solving skills and detail oriented, analytical mind in the world of accounting and finance, but now I have expanded my knowledge base.  As I added knowledge and skills within software development at the Tech Academy I have enjoyed the research, analysis, and the joys of finding creative solutions and am excited to continue my progress and continuous learning in the professional environment.
