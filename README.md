### Portfolio
***

Previously I used my problem-solving skills and detail oriented, analytical approach in the world of accounting and finance.  But now I have expanded my knowledge base by adding skills with software development at the Tech Academy in Portland, Oregon.  I've enjoyed the research, analysis, and the exhilaration of finding creative solutions and I am excited to progress and continuously learn within the fast-paced, dynamic world of technology.
